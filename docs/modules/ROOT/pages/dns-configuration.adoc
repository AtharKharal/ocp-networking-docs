= DNS Configuration in OpenShift
:page-title: DNS Configuration
:page-aliases: networking/dns.adoc

== Introduction

DNS in OpenShift resolves internal service names and allows external name resolution using `dns-default` pods.

== Cluster DNS Architecture

* Each node runs a CoreDNS pod.
* Upstream DNS resolution is managed by `/etc/resolv.conf` in nodes.
* OpenShift injects cluster-specific search domains.

== Editing DNS Configuration

To add upstream DNS servers:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: DNS
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  servers:
  - name: custom-upstream
    forwardPlugin:
      upstreams:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 1.1.1.1
----

== Best Practices

* Avoid recursive loops by validating upstream servers.
* Use unique suffixes for internal resolution.
