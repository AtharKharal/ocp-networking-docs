:description: Overview of networking components, configuration layers, and architecture in OpenShift.

This section provides an architectural and operational overview of networking in OpenShift. It covers cluster network configuration, service routing, ingress and egress control, and relevant security constraints. OpenShift builds upon Kubernetesâ€™ native networking model and extends it with enhanced routing, isolation, and observability features.

== Core Networking Concepts

OpenShift networking is built on three interrelated layers:

. **Pod-to-Pod Communication (Cluster Network):** Every pod receives a unique IP address. OpenShift ensures full L3 connectivity between pods across nodes, without NAT.
. **Service Abstraction (Virtual IPs):** Services expose stable virtual IPs and DNS names for accessing dynamic sets of pods (endpoints) via kube-proxy.
. **Ingress and Egress (External Traffic):** Ingress controllers route external HTTP(S) traffic to services; Egress policies define how pods reach outside networks.

|===
| Component | Description

| Cluster Network
| An overlay or SDN-managed network that assigns routable IPs to all pods. Managed by OpenShift SDN, OVN-Kubernetes, or third-party CNI providers.

| Services
| Abstractions for stable access to dynamic pod sets. Types include ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

| DNS
| Internal DNS resolution via CoreDNS. Services and pods are assigned names such as `my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`.

| Ingress Controller
| A managed HAProxy or Envoy-based reverse proxy that handles HTTP(S) traffic from external clients into the cluster.

| Network Policies
| Layer 3/4 firewall rules that isolate traffic between namespaces or workloads based on labels and ports.

| Egress Router / Egress Firewall
| Mechanisms to control and monitor pod-initiated outbound traffic to external networks.

| Load Balancer
| External load balancing provided by cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS ELB, GCP LB) or MetalLB in bare-metal setups.

== Supported Network Plugins

OpenShift supports the following Container Network Interface (CNI) providers:

* **OVN-Kubernetes:** The default SDN in recent OpenShift versions. Implements native Kubernetes NetworkPolicy and supports multicast, egress IPs, and dual-stack IPv4/IPv6.
* **OpenShift SDN (deprecated):** A legacy SDN solution, now superseded by OVN-Kubernetes.
* **Third-Party CNIs:** Calico, Cilium, and others are available via custom installation paths, but may limit support for certain OpenShift features.

== Network Policy Enforcement

OpenShift enables fine-grained control over inter-pod traffic through Kubernetes NetworkPolicies:

* Policies are namespace-scoped and deny-all by default if any policy exists.
* Rules match traffic using pod selectors, namespace selectors, and port specifications.
* Only CNI plugins with NetworkPolicy support (e.g., OVN-Kubernetes, Calico) can enforce these rules.

== Ingress and Routing

Ingress and routing in OpenShift are managed through Routes or Ingress objects:

* **Routes:** OpenShift-specific objects that expose services via customizable hostnames, TLS termination, and path-based routing.
* **Ingress:** Standard Kubernetes resources supported via the ingress controller.
* Wildcard routes and sticky sessions are supported.

Ingress Controllers can be scaled, customized, or scoped to specific namespaces using `IngressController` CRs in `openshift-ingress-operator`.

== Egress Control and Observability

Outbound traffic is managed and monitored via:

* **Egress IPs:** Assign static IPs to specific namespaces or pods for outbound traffic.
* **Egress Routers:** Route traffic from pods through predefined external destinations.
* **Egress Firewall:** Enforce allow/deny policies for external destinations.
* **NetFlow/IPFIX Exporters:** For traffic analysis and audit.

== Advanced Topics

* **Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking**
* **Multicast support**
* **MetalLB integration for on-prem L2/L3 load balancing**
* **SR-IOV and DPDK for high-performance networking**
* **Service Mesh (Istio-based):** Fine-grained traffic routing, mTLS, and observability

== Final Notes

Networking forms the backbone of cluster operation and must be configured carefully during installation. Many network settings, such as cluster CIDRs and SDN choice, are immutable post-installation.

For production-grade deployments, thorough testing of ingress, egress, and network policy behavior is essential.
