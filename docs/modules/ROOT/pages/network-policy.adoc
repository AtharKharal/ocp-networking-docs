== Overview

Network policies control the communication between pods and services within a Kubernetes cluster.
They are essential for enforcing security boundaries and managing east-west traffic.

== Prerequisites

* OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later
* Cluster network plugin must support network policies (e.g., OpenShift SDN or OVN-Kubernetes)

== Creating a Basic NetworkPolicy

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-web
  namespace: frontend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: web
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: backend
----

== Applying the Policy

Use `oc` CLI:

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f allow-web.yaml
----

== Troubleshooting

* Use `oc describe` to validate selectors.
* Confirm the pod labels match the policy selector.
